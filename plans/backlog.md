Top of Mind
- priority 1 should be most severe
- rename all py_home scriptable tasks with the PY_prefix, carefully repair any references to the script names

Reliability
- investigate TempStick monitor false alarm exceptions (sensor works, but monitor logs exceptions)
- review ntfy alerts

Advanced Integrations
- checkvist (API config exists, needs shortcuts)
- alen air purifier integration (test Tuya API, verify device IDs)
- roborock vacuum integration (check availability, test API)
- grow light automation (config exists, needs scheduler hook)

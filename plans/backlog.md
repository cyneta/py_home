## ðŸŽ¯ Ready to Work

Quick wins and high-value tasks ready to start.

| Task | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Fix 71 Pytest Warnings** | Low | 1-2h | Replace `return True` with `assert True` in tests |
| **Grow Light Automation** | Medium | 1-2h | Config exists, needs time-based scheduler hook |
| **Make Bedroom Heater Settable** | Low | 1h | Currently only on/off, add temp control if possible |

## ðŸ”¨ Needs Planning

Larger tasks that need design/research before implementation.

| Task | Complexity | Blocker | Next Step |
|------|------------|---------|-----------|
| **HomePod Environment Sensors** | Medium | No direct API | Create webhook endpoint, HomeKit automation setup |
| **Alen Air Purifier Integration** | Medium | Partial config exists | Test Tuya API, verify device IDs work |
| **Roborock Vacuum Integration** | Medium | Hardware needed? | Check if vacuum is available, test API |
| **Backup System for Pi** | Medium | Need strategy | Design: rsync? git backup? cloud? |
| **Audit Dry-Run Test System** | Medium | None | Review test patterns, verify isolation |

---

## ðŸ’¡ Feature Ideas

Nice-to-have features, low priority.

| Task | Value | Complexity | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|-------|
| **YouTube Music Integration** | Low | Medium | iOS shortcuts for playlists/control |
| **Checkvist Integration** | Low | Low | Already has API config, needs shortcuts |
| **HomePod Siri Shortcuts** | Low | Medium | Voice control for HomePod speakers |
| **Extract Design Principles** | Medium | Low | Document patterns (already doing organically) |

**Current System Status:**
- ‚úÖ Core automations working (goodnight, good_morning, leaving_home, im_home, temp_coordination)
- ‚úÖ All major integrations deployed (Nest, Sensibo, Tapo, network presence, notifications)
- ‚úÖ Test suite complete (165/165 tests passing, 100% coverage)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard implemented and deployed
- ‚úÖ Flask webhook server running as systemd service
- ‚úÖ Structured logging (kvlog) across all components

**Outstanding High-Priority Work:**
1. **Geofencing** - iOS location integration for pre-arrival conditioning (planned, not started)
2. **Tuya/Alen Integration** - Air purifier control (planned, not started)
3. **VPN Setup** - Secure remote access to Pi (user requested)
4. **Dashboard Enhancements** - Already functional, could add websockets/charts
5. **Legacy Task Cleanup** - Update TASKS.md to reflect actual implementation status

- ‚úÖ Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ Dark theme, mobile-responsive
- ‚úÖ Accessible at http://raspberrypi.local:5000/dashboard

**What Plan Called For (Not Implemented):**
- ‚ùå Separate `web/status_server.py` Flask app
- ‚ùå Separate systemd service (`py_home_status.service`)
- ‚ùå Event log browser with filtering
- ‚ùå `web/templates/` directory structure
- ‚ùå `/api/state` and `/api/events` JSON endpoints
- ‚ùå Advanced filtering (errors, success, limit)

## Conclusion

The py_home system is **production-ready** with robust core functionality. Legacy planning documents are outdated but reflect significant completed work not formally marked as done.

**Key Insight:** Most "not started" tasks in TASKS.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md are actually **complete in production** - the plans just haven't been updated.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement VPN (user priority)
2. Update documentation to reflect actual state
3. Decide on advanced features based on user needs
4. Archive outdated plans
